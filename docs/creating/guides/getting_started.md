# So you want to make some mods

There's two kinds of mods:
1. The ones that are simple and amount to changing the name and stats of an ingame weapon, these are actually easy.
2. The one that sounds simple but aren't, which just about covers everything else not mentioned in 1.
   
# Downloading the Tools

1. [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   1. You want to make sure to get the following extenions: `Lua` by sumneko and BG3 Text by dev_chromosome16
2. [BG3 Modders Multitool](https://github.com/ShinyHobo/BG3-Modders-Multitool)
   1. There is a wiki at that website that will help you get started but feel free to ask as well
3. [ConverterApp/LSLib](https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib)

# Actually Getting Started
1. First thing, setup Multitool. You need to point it to your bg3.exe, which you can do under Configuration
2. Click the Search Index button and let it index
3. Peruse the information [here](https://github.com/ShinyHobo/BG3-Modders-Multitool/wiki/Mod-Workspace-Structure) on multitool workspaces.
