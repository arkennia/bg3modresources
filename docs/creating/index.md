* Photo editing software that can work with dds images.
  * [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
  * [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/)
  * Photoshop
  * Substance Painter
* 3D Modeling Tools ([Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a good free one)
  * Norbyte created [this](https://github.com/Norbyte/dos2de_collada_exporter) plugin for Blender for working with the game files.
* [BG3 Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se)
* [BG3 Modders Multitool](https://github.com/ShinyHobo/BG3-Modders-Multitool)
