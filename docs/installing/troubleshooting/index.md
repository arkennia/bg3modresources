# Troubleshooting Your Game

If you are having issues with your game, here are a few fixes for the most common issues.

## Mod Fixer
Yes, even now in patch 3, Mod Fixer is required.  
"But some youtuber said I don-"  
No you still need it.  
It won't break anything, and is needed for so many mods to work properly.
Here is a link to the correct one: [Mod Fixer from figs999](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/141).

When you install this mod, often times it will create a folder in your mods directory. Make sure it doesn't do that or it won't work. To verify it did not, go to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods` and make sure there are no folders at all, only .pak files.

## Reset Modsettings
Sometimes no matter what you try the game will simply not work. The first step to trying to fix this is generally resetting the modsettings.lsx file. You can find a guide here: [resetting Modsettings.lsx](/bg3modresources/installing/troubleshooting/modsettings).
